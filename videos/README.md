## How to Add Your Own Video

1. **Download a video** of someone listening to music from one of these free sources:
   - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/videos/search/person%20listening%20to%20music/)
   - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos/search/person%20listening%20to%20music/)
   - [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/listening/)
   - [Coverr](https://coverr.co/stock-video-footage/listening-to-music)

2. **Save the video** in this directory as `person-listening-music.mp4`

3. **Recommended video specifications:**
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
   - File size: Keep under 10MB for better performance

4. **Update index.php:**
   - The video will automatically be used if it exists in this directory
   - The page will fall back to online sources if the local file is not found

## Current Setup

The website currently uses online video sources from Pexels/Pixabay as fallbacks. Once you add your own video file here, you can use it instead.
